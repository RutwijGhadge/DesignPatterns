Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object
to control access to it .

The Proxy pattern involves creating a class that acts as an intermediary between a client and a real object.
It provides an interface identical to the original object, allowing clients to interact with the proxy object as
if it were the real object. The proxy object then handles the requests and, if necessary, forwards them to the real object.

Benefits of using the Proxy Design Pattern:
Controlled access: The Proxy pattern allows you to control access to an object.
It acts as a gatekeeper, deciding whether or not a client can access the real object.
This helps in enforcing security and access restrictions, ensuring that only authorized clients can interact with the object.

Resource management: Proxies can help manage resources efficiently. For example, if you have an expensive object that
takes time to create or initialize, a proxy can postpone its creation until it is actually needed.
This lazy initialization improves performance and resource utilization.

Simplified interface: Proxies provide a simplified interface to clients, making it easier to work with complex systems.
Clients can interact with the proxy object in the same way they would with the real object,
without needing to be aware of the underlying complexity or implementation details.

Caching and optimization: Proxies can implement caching mechanisms to store the results of expensive operations.
When a client requests the same operation again, the proxy can serve the result from the cache instead of invoking the real object.
This reduces processing time and improves overall system performance.
Easy maintenance: Proxies can provide a layer of indirection, allowing you to make changes to the real object without affecting the clients.
You can introduce new proxy types or modify their behavior without impacting the overall system.
This improves maintainability and allows for easier updates and enhancements.
