/*
Once upon a time, there was a developer who thought code was too complex.
She wanted a way to create objects without the hassle of defining their properties every time.
Then, she discovered the 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧 🚀
The Builder design pattern is a classic pattern in software engineering that helps build complex objects using simple steps.
Here's how it works:
Suppose you need to create a complex object with many optional attributes. Instead of having multiple constructors with different parameters, you can use the builder design pattern.
First, create a builder class that matches the complex object’s structure. Each attribute has a method that can set its value.
Next, create a director class that will use the builder class to create objects. It has a set of methods that define the order in which the builder's methods will be called.
Finally, call the director's method to build the object instance.

Here's an example:

public class Car {
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int year;
    private String color;
    private boolean isElectric;

    public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public void setElectric(boolean electric) {
        isElectric = electric;
    }

    // Getters and setters omitted for conciseness
    public static class Builder {
        private String make;
        private String model;
        private int year;
        private String color;
        private boolean isElectric;

        public Builder(String make, String model, int year) {
            this.make = make;
            this.model = model;
            this.year = year;
        }

        public Builder withColor(String color) {
            this.color = color;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder withElectric(boolean electric) {
            isElectric = electric;
            return this;
        }

        public Car build() {
            Car car = new Car(make, model, year);
            car.setColor(color);
            car.setElectric(isElectric);
            return car;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car.Builder("Tesla", "Model S", 2023)
                .withColor("Red")
                .withElectric(true)
                .build();
    }
}
